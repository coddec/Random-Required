# Random-Required

A random string generator that can take numbers, letters, symbols, Chinese characters and arbitrary input as source to generate random string or text based on custom settings.

- When output length and output quantity is set to very high value, the webpage/browser might freeze for a while during generation.
- Long input type will have more advantage over short input type. e.g. with string "abcdefg5", output length set to 2, output quantity set to 5, the output will likely to be cf db fd gb a5 instead of 5a b5 5d 5g f5.
